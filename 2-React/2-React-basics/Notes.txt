React component
-----------------

    - props  ==>  (any data from parent-component to child-componenet )
    - state  ==>  (internal data , based on that it will render )



  3 phases

  phase-1 : Mounting   ==> initial rendering
  phase-2 : Updating   ==> re rendering  
  phase-3 : UnMounting   ==> destroy
